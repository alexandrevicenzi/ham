# Hammer (ham)

Hammer is a tool to manage big projects that consist of
multiple git repositories, which are loosely coupled.

It provides global sync of all managed repositories,
global operations for all or a subset of the repositories,
and integration with Gerrit Code Review.

The outstanding feature is support for consistent changes
in multiple repositories.
